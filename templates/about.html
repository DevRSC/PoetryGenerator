        <p class="desc1">This poetry generator will randomly grab lines from Shakespeare's sonnets and poems to produce a completely new poem.</br></br>
        This poetry generator uses Recurrent Neural Networks and Markov Chains in order to generate new verses in the style of the 
        poems that it is given as input. The Markov Chains are used to build new sentences, while the Recurrent Neural Networks are 
        used to predict the properties of the next line of the poem (e.g., number of syllables, rhyme scheme) such that an appropriate 
        new sentence can be selected (from the sentences that were generated with Markovify).
